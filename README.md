This Python script is a Twitter bot that automatically tweets a random philosopher quote four times a day at 9:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 5:00 PM, and 9:00 PM (Toronto time). It also features an active clock in the terminal that updates every second, showing the current time, the next tweet's scheduled time, and the time remaining until the next tweet.

In order to improve it next time I could use another API to get the quotes instead of storing them in a local array.

This bot is being hosted on a remote server which I have access to. Therefore it is able to run 24/7.
